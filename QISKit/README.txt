The code upon which the QISKit VQE examples is based can be found in this tutorial: https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua-tutorials/blob/master/aqua/vqe_qasm.py. This tutorial code has been modified and used as it is a reconfigurable and workable example of how the VQE can be performed upon multiple devices and with changes to the structure of operation. It thus serves as a great illustrative example of this type of NISQ algorithm.
