\frametitle{Overview}
\begin{minipage}{0.52\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python based quantum programming libraries
    \item Tried programming the common programs (e.g. Grover's, Shor's, etc.)
    \item Tried compiling a simple program for different hardware platforms (i.e. with gate restrictions, etc.)
    \item We've written a programming guide -- we're currently reviewing it
\end{itemize}

# do measurement over all 8 qubits

\frametitle{Short comparison}
\begin{columns}
\column{0.46\textwidth}
    \begin{block}{What is there}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focused on quantum circuits
        \item Apply gates to specific qubits
        \item Classical control in the same source code
        \item Python syntax is beginner friendly
        \item Simulators are available
        \item Hardware compilers are available
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    %
\column{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{block}{What is lacking}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some languages target specific hardware
            \item Some simulators are cloud based and require accounts
            \item Lack of support for custom unitaries
            \item Compilers are not highly developed
            \item No real quantum programming constructs (e.g. quantum if etc.)
        \end{itemize}
        \end{block}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cloud based quantum computing}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The superconducting qubit developers (IBM, Rigetti, Google, etc.) have made their
      hardware accessible through the cloud. 
  \item Released software written in Python for use on their simulators and hardware.
    \item We found the connection would time out for
        moderate sized quantum circuits.
%  \item IBM recently introduced their new API \cite{mckay2018qiskit} which uses JSON files to control runs. They have added pulse shaping. \footnote{Aimed at physicists}

% Structure of quantum computers
\begin{frame}{Structure of classical computers}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Harvard_architecture.png}
  \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{micro.jpg}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Classical computers have a lot of internal structure -- they are not just a collection of addressable bits.
  \item Classical computers are controlled using an instruction set, which has elementary operations for arithmetic, control, moving data around, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Structure of quantum computers
\begin{frame}{Structure of quantum computers}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{nearestneighbourcon.png}
  \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{qproc.jpg}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Quantum processing units (QPUs) currently comprise a lattice of qubits which can be manipulated and measured.
  \item The only `instructions' which can be performed are qubit initialisation, gate operations, and measurement
  \item Will QPUs eventually involve higher level structures like in the classical case? This will determine the type of languages that will control the devices
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% slide 4
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion: long term programming languages}
\begin{itemize}
\item The structure of long term languages depends on the structure of long term quantum computers
\item We need a quantum instruction set that isn't just listing gates. We want to see coherent \textbf{addition}, \textbf{multiplication}, \textbf{exponentiation}, etc. Possible also coherent \textbf{branching}?
\item Don't see Python being the long term quantum language -- there's no need to wrap assembly language in high level syntax. 
\item Existing Python libraries not built to be scalable languages. Heavy focus on quantum circuits, not useful for new algorithms.
\end{itemize}
